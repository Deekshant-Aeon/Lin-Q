## üèÅ Introduction
Welcome to Lin-Q! This is a high-performance, header-only query library designed for C++. With this library, you can easily create LINQ-style queries in your C++ projects without the hassle of complicated setups. Whether you are working on data processing, transformations, or querying collections, Lin-Q makes it efficient and straightforward.

## üöÄ Getting Started
To work with Lin-Q, you will need a C++ compiler and a basic understanding of how to include libraries in your projects. Below, we outline the steps for you to download and run Lin-Q on your machine.

## üì• Download & Install
To get started, follow these steps carefully:

1. **Visit the Releases Page**: Click the button below to open the Releases page.

2. **Choose the Latest Version**: On the Releases page, find the latest version of Lin-Q. Look for the version marked as "Latest Release."

3. **Download the Library**: Click on the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file to download it to your computer.

4. **Extract the Files**: Once the download completes, extract the files by right-clicking on the downloaded file and selecting ‚ÄúExtract All‚Äù or using your preferred extraction tool.

5. **Include Lin-Q in Your Project**:
   - Locate the extracted folder. Inside, you will find header files.
   - Copy these header files into your project directory or link them directly in your project settings.

## üîß Basic Usage
Once you have incorporated Lin-Q into your project, here‚Äôs how to use it effectively:

1. **Include the Header**: At the top of your C++ file, include Lin-Q.
   ```cpp
   #include "LinQ.h"
   ```

2. **Create Queries**: You can start creating queries using Lin-Q's syntax. Here is a simple example.
   ```cpp
   auto results = LinQ::from(data)
                      .where([](const Item& item) { return item.value > 10; })
                      .select([](const Item& item) { return item.name; });
   ```

3. **Compile Your Project**: Ensure your compiler settings include the path to Lin-Q's headers. Compile your project as usual.

4. **Run Your Application**: Execute your application to see the results of your Lin-Q queries in action.
